                        <p>How I coped with being made redundant during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*FazGiUI7y3rVP_Wy" /></figure><p><em>-Shit, here it comes, she is going to say it, I know she will.</em></p><p>“So, unfortunately, you are now one of the staff members being made redundant at this time. I know this is a lot to take in. Do you need to take a moment?” My synapses fire, slowly at first, generating the smallest of thought bubbles. Like an avalanche, they quickly cascade into a torrent of fear and disbelief.</p><p><em>-Please no, oh no, this can’t be happening.</em></p><p>I struggle to speak. My mouth is so dry I reach instinctively for the glass of water on my makeshift desk.</p><p><em>-Fear drives the mouth. If I pick the glass will she see my hand tremble? Take a sip at least, comforting. Something to do with my hands, at least.</em></p><p>My amygdala goes into overdrive, fight or flight. The instinctive fear centre of the brain is stuck on transmit, blocking any ability to hold even the simplest of thoughts in my head, let alone form a coherent sentence. “No, it’s fine, please let’s go on” is all I can muster.</p><p><em>-Of course, it bloody well isn’t. Nothing will ever be the same again</em></p><p>After twenty years — almost to the day — since I started at my firm as a senior web developer, I am for the high jump, the scrap heap, the junk pile, the can. I am no longer needed, surplus to requirements.</p><p><em>-It’s all over for me.</em></p><p>I try to focus so I can at least make it through the rest of the <strong>Zoom</strong> call. What follows is some legal jargon that I register and a perfunctory comment from HR about “how difficult this has been for us” and the process is over. There is nothing more to say. The call is complete. As quickly as I can I say “goodbye”, shut down my office laptop and shuffle out of my temporary bedroom cum office to the living room where my expectant parents wait for the news. But they don’t have to ask; they can see it written all over my face. “They have made me redundant” I declare and fall into the couch, heart-broken, dejected.</p><p><em>-How do I not take this personally? If it wasn’t for Covid-19 I would still have my job and life would have gone as it always did, so it’s not me, it’s the times we are living in.</em></p><p>In the initial hours and days after the call this a thought I barely have a grip on. At any moment I feel like my hands, laced with anxiety-induced sweat, will slip.</p><p>I had assumed that as one of the few staff members who was not furloughed in March when the lockdown began, my job was secure. I had worked day-in, day-out through the weeks and months the pandemic raged, seeing Spring turn into Summer, safe in my little cave of coding. The faith the business had instilled in me was just enough to keep me working through the long months of the lockdown. Set adrift from my colleagues, with little or no communication from management, I often felt like a tiny raft adrift on an immense ocean, stuck in the doldrums with no wind or sight of land. But I made it through, the lockdown was easing, and I was starting to hear from people again. Requests started appearing in my inbox, colleagues signalling from distant shores in need of my help. Land ho. Things were turning around, and life returned to the semblance of normality, or so I thought.</p><p>Truth be told, I had been unhappy for the past year, if not longer. In July 2019 my firm had cancelled a project I had worked on for three years. It was a blow. Not only for all the work I had put into it but also because the project leader, someone I had worked with during my whole tenure, a friend and confidant, was made redundant in the process. At least I could take some comfort knowing that I had built a powerful, well regarded, web application that I could be proud of, and one that had pushed my development skills in new directions. The fact that this quality product was not to be supported by the business should have been a warning sign, but I carried on as normal, hoping for the best. It was easier to do nothing than something.</p><blockquote>Forty years I’d been asking permission to piss. I can’t squeeze a drop without say-so<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a></blockquote><p>Perhaps some of my unhappiness lay in the <em>never-changing</em> structure of my life. Not only had I worked in the same firm for twenty years, but I had also lived in the same flat for almost all of that time. I had moved in just months after starting my new job and distinctly remember the feeling of freedom of having my very own pad in town just walk from the office. After many years spent financially struggling in academia, I had finally constructed a comfortable, productive life for myself. A challenging job in a family-run business, a bachelor pad within walking distance of the office, no attachments, few responsibilities, no hassles, just me, myself and I. But over time the very things I used to find comfort and protect myself had become the walls of a prison. I had built a fortress around myself from which I could not escape. Like “Red” and “Brooks Hatlen”, two of the inmates in the prison drama <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, the fear of life outside my routine had crippled me into inaction. Like those character I had become an <strong>institutional man</strong> I had not tried to leave; even looked for any other jobs, in fact, I had made no plans of any kind, or at least I couldn’t remember the last time I had.</p><figure><img alt="Brooks Hatlen, the institutional man, fearful of the new world he is about to enter after years inside" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*i6xZGYmtKh5oogt1" /></figure><p>During this period I had also become increasingly disillusioned with my lifestyle, living on my own in my one bed flat in central London. The walls were closing in around me, I was starting to feel restricted, confined. The lack of space, the seemingly constant maintenance required for a period townhouse, and, most recently, the addition of noisy, inconsiderate neighbours all contributed to my increasing sense of entrapment. If that wasn’t enough, my ceiling has collapsed just before Christmas. The walls were literally collapsing around me but I had clung to my pad like a life raft refusing to budge, to move on. I kept telling myself the convenience of being so centrally located, of not having to commute was all the mattered. “Location, Location, Location” became a mantra that had fixed me to the spot. More of the same.</p><p><em>-Just don’t do anything, it’ll be alright.</em></p><p>And this state of permanent inaction is where I was in March 2020 when our firm was hit by a cyber-attack serious enough to shut down the network, temporarily crippling the business and temporarily shutting down the London office. In this pre-lockdown state I had decided that as there was no point sitting around in my flat all alone with nothing to do but wait, I would stay with my parents and wait for the office to reboot. While I was ensconced in their flat, the threat of coronavirus, a story I had followed since January, was looming ever larger on the news horizon. My parents, being retired, spend an inordinate amount of time watching the 24-hour TVnews cycle so there was no way to avoid the terrifying stories about a <strong>lockdown</strong> happening in Italy.</p><blockquote>“It’s not an emergency it’s a war”</blockquote><p>I particularly remember this headline from those days in early March 2020. The ominous phrase filled me with the dread of the events unfolding abroad and what I feared would take place here in the UK soon enough.</p><figure><img alt="The empty world of the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*DBZufbLBYPGwqlk-" /></figure><p>Now I was not only grappling with the existential fear of entrapment but also the very real fear of the looming crisis of a global pandemic. It was like the worst kind of nightmare straight out of an episode of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror"> Black Mirror</a>. I couldn’t possibly face this alone in the prison I had built for myself. Like many other around the world, my anxiety levels went through the roof.</p><p>With this in mind, and while still at my parents, we had an intense family meeting and decided that the best thing for me would be to ride the pandemic out with them. So I headed back home to pick up enough clothes, toiletries for a few weeks and hoped for the best while preparing for the worst.</p><figure><img alt="My makeshift office in lockdown" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hf_VUKBGfAjVo-3h" /></figure><p>Just one week later, on the 23 March 2020, the lockdown began and I found myself in a new makeshift office cobbled together in the spare room of my parents’ flat. And that is where I was on the day of my redundancy, like a teenager opening his exam results, hoping it would all be ok, that I’ll get the grades, pass muster, stand the test, prove myself worthy, that my future would be secured. But it wasn’t to be.</p><p>Now redundant and trapped in lockdown away from home I was forced to focus on the what had created the “institutional man”</p><p>I think the <strong>fear of change</strong> is something we all grapple with. I know it runs deep in my family. My parents lived in the same house for over 40 years. My brothers and cousins have all barely moved houses or jobs in all those years. Even many of my friends have had not changed jobs in all that time. Perhaps that is no surprise considering that “birds of a feather flock together”.</p><p>We often find ourselves in an echo chamber of familiarity.</p><p>The family thing is different. I didn’t choose to be a member. If the fear of change is endemic, then surely I had no choice in not choosing, in staying rooted to the spot of my life. This makes me think about free will. Is it an illusion? Do we comfort ourselves in believing we have choices that we don’t ultimately have, that we are powerless to act against our nature? If we don’t have free will then how can we ever attribute blame.</p><p><em>-How can I blame myself if I had no choice?</em></p><p>I have to admit it is very comforting to negate responsibility for the choices I have made, or rather the ones I failed to make. I didn’t choose to be made redundant any more than I chose to join the firm in the beginning — I was, in fact, part of a smaller business that was bought out and I was part of that package.</p><p>If I hadn’t specifically chosen to join, I had made choices to further my career. My position as the <strong>senior web developer</strong> in my firm was a million miles from where I started as a researcher, cum journalist. But like everything else in my life that journey had now stalled. When I was offered voluntary redundancy, I felt powerless to take it, to grasp the opportunity.</p><p>“I just don’t have the guts to make that kind of decision” I remember telling a colleague who begged me to reconsider, to take the deal I was offered.</p><p>It was not a choice I was able to make; it had to be made for me. The day after I got the news I was talking to my brother, who was trying his best to console me, when I had an epiphany. We were talking about the possibility of appealing the decision, of fighting for my old job. I was pretty sure I had a case to be heard. But it made me realise something important.</p><p><em>- I wouldn’t want the job back even if it was offered to me.</em></p><p>Why would I want to stay in a business that had once again demonstrated a failure to get behind digital at a time when that was one of the industries that would most likely survive or even benefit from the pandemic.</p><p>As Brian A Wong Vice-President of the Alibaba group stated in June of 2020 at the world economic forum, “The ability to leverage digital tools has become a must for businesses to survive the ongoing crisis.”</p><p>On a personal level, if fear was the only thing that kept me from leaving, and I had now left, then that fear no longer had any hold over me. In choosing not to appeal, I set myself free. Or maybe I simply realised that this was an opportunity for a new job, a new life, and hopefully, a happy, more contented one where I can (pretend, perhaps) to make choices, construct plans, and dream up a future for myself. This is how a light started to shine for me in what was a very dark tunnel — a bright light of possibilities.</p><p>While living in lockdown it often felt like the distance between our loved ones had grown so very long. As if the pandemic had somehow stretched the very fabric of space, making us all distant stars of one another, exacerbating the already prevalent feeling in our society that the internet, far from making us more interconnected, has cut us more adrift from each other than ever before. The microcosm of my life was being writ large by the macrocosm of the world in <strong>lockdown</strong>. We were all in our “fortresses of solitude”. But if that were true if our lives were so disconnected, would the pandemic have had such a global reach, would the virus have been so hard to contain? What would it have been like to live with the lockdown without the internet, Zoom chats, Google <em>Hangouts</em>, <em>Goto Meetings</em> and <em>Microsoft Teams</em>? It would have been unbearable. Seeing friends and family, even through a webcam darkly, was better than not at all. It felt now that I had made the right choice in not spending the lockdown alone in my flat. Being with my parents saved me, not just in the first tearful hours of my redundancy, but in the days and weeks since, as did the friends who rallied around me, gave me words of encouragement and made that all-important connection. I had made a positive choice.</p><p>The day after the redundancy two of my close friends, one of whom I had made while at the firm, visited me at my parents. It was the first time I had seen any friends for months. It was so wonderful to see them, to talk in person to someone other than my family. They had both been made redundant and so they knew exactly what to say. As they offered words of consolation over my first pint of beer in months (it tasted so sweet!), I realised that making this connection was the best panacea for the many forms of isolation I had been suffering from. Hearing from the people around me did more to lift my spirits and make me feel connected than I could have imagined possible. Friendship makes those prison walls seem less unassailable. Maybe I can change. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqCWZLToZoQ">words of a song by Morcheeba </a>spring to mind:</p><blockquote>“Fear can stop you loving<br> Love can stop your fear”</blockquote><p>So if you know of anyone who is struggling with redundancy, ill health, bereavement or disconnection and want to reach out to them, send that text, post that Facebook message, start the zoom call, whatever it might be just to let them know they are not alone. It will help. It’s better to hear the wrong thing than nothing at all. We all need connection maybe more so now in this time of cholera.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=83112fdc6901" width="1" height="1">
