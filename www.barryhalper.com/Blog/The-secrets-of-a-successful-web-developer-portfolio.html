                        <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/0*P025woMs5c36Ljq7" /></figure><p>Due to the current economic climate, I recently found myself having to look for a new job as a web developer. As a technical lead who has spent years hiring developers, it was an unusual challenge to be on the other side the fence as a candidate. What follows are a few of the secrets I used to meet this challenge by creating the kind of portfolio I would like to have seen when I was recruiting. Secrets which I hope will be useful if you are currently looking for a new role as a developer in these trying times.</p><p>As a developer, you need an online portfolio. I realise this is stating the obvious, but it’s so important it’s worth reiterating. The print medium isn’t best suited to illustrate your online skills, so just having a CV document doesn’t quite cut the mustard in the digital world. That means you need to build and publish your own website to show what can do as a developer. You might be tempted to short-cut this and use an online web builder but I would advice against that as it defeats the purpose of the exercise — to show what you can <em>do </em>rather than what you can <em>use</em>.</p><p><strong>Buy a domain</strong><br>Now is not the time to hide your identity with Twitter-style “handles”. Buy a domain for your own name under which you will publish the site. It is also a good idea to create a business email address with this domain. e.g. <a href="http://me@barryhalper.com">me@barryhalper.com</a>. This looks more professional than the <em>name12456@gmail.com </em>address you probably have for your personal email. <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> is a reliable place to buy domains and manage email accounts.</p><p><strong>Publish your code<br></strong>When hiring developers, I always found it useful to review the candidate’s code. <a href="https://github.com/">Github </a>is the industry-standard online code repository and publishing examples of your work on it is the best way of giving employers this opportunity. Due to intellectual property law, you may not be able to publish the code you wrote for a former employer, so building your own site and publishing its’ code gets around this problem. Set up an account and upload your work ready for inspection but be sure only to deploy your best and what you can reasonably take credit for. In my experience, it is easy to spot a <em>bluffer </em>when it comes to interviews.</p><p><strong>Choosing a development platform<br></strong>It is important to demonstrate two key features of your development skills with your project; experience and relevancy. For example, with own, it made sense to build it using .NET MVC as the framework being the one with which I have the most experience. Conscious, however, that the <strong>.NET Framework </strong>is pretty <em>mature </em>these days, I decided to opt for the more relevant .<strong>NET Core</strong>. Likewise, choose whatever platform you are most comfortable with while checking that the version you are using is the most up to date to demonstrates you are well versed in the latest web trends.</p><p><strong>Database Providers<br></strong>A full-stack or back-end developer should be able to demonstrate the core skill of database integration. However, using a relational database such a <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> or <strong>PostgresSQL</strong> is overkill for a project of this size. I recommend going with a NoSQL database such a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>. It is free, easy to set up and simple to learn. MongoDB’s use of JSON documents as data storage fits seamlessly with the web’s object-orientated programming languages with which you are probably familiar.</p><p><strong>Front End Development<br></strong>When it comes to the HTML and CSS, I see no point in reinventing the wheel. This is why CSS frameworks are so useful. They do the heavy markup lifting and thereby provide the freedom to focus on design rather than its implementation. I’ve used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for countless websites over the years and find it easy to use, taking most of the headaches out of writing well-formed, semantic, markup. You can also take a look <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">CSS Grid Layout</a>, another popular CSS framework.</p><p><strong>Online, content is king.<br></strong>When looking over a candidate’s portfolio, I would often go straight to the list of skills to gauge their level of experience. Adding one to a portfolio would therefore be helpful for employers. Testimonials are another good idea as they help inspire confidence in your “brand”. You should also include your projects. When deciding which ones to include, it’s more effective to showcase a few examples of your best work rather than an exhaustive list of everything you have done. Employers don’t want to spend their time scrolling through endless examples. Less is most definitely more. Whatever content you include, it should be clear and concise with as many links and examples as possible.</p><p><strong>Call to action</strong><br>The most prominent call to action should visually represent a website’s primary purpose.<strong> </strong>For your portfolio, this should be the ability to contact you. Along with a prominent “contact” button, provide as many options as possible to contact you with links to your email and social media channels. A form is also helpful but not essential and only consider it if your hosting package provides HTTPS to ensure security for your users.</p><p><strong>Design</strong><br>While I am not a front-end developer getting stuck into design comes with the territory when you work in the full stack. If you are a back end developer design is nothing to fear, nor is it the rarefied, innate skill some designers would have you to believe. Design is just another tool anyone can acquire with enough knowledge and practice. Good design is just a means of conveying your message distinctly and clearly (although for my own site’s home page I leaned more towards the former in an attempt to stand out from the crowd).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/813/0*9ugUfp31wH_M7cKK" /><figcaption>My homepage</figcaption></figure><p>“Web design” should not be confused with functionality. I have seen plenty of portfolios with too many animations, transitions and widgets that obscure rather than illuminate. Design is about clarity, and that goal should outweigh the need to demonstrate your coding prowess.</p><p><strong>Publish and Promote<br></strong>The chances of a newly launched portfolio site ranking highly on any SERPS (search engine results page) is pretty remote. It is unlikely therefore any employer is going to <em>stumble</em> onto your portfolio “organically” However, you should at least demonstrate an understanding of best practice <strong>SEO </strong>(search engine optimisation) with your site:-</p><ul><li>Ensure you have well-formed semantic makeup, by parsing it through the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validation </a>tool.</li><li>Structure your pages to improve their <em>keyword density</em>, e.g. on a <strong>contact </strong>page, ensure the word “contact” appears in the page’s URL, the &lt;Title&gt;, the<em> </em>&lt;H1&gt;<em> </em>and the meta description.</li><li><a href="https://www.minifier.org/">Minify all</a> .your .css and .js files and optimise your images to ensure the fastest possible download speeds for your users.</li></ul><p>There is a common misconception that search engines will “magically” find any new site posted online and add it to their search. This is not the case. A search engine will only add your new site if it instructed to do so. Use <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google’s search engine console</a> to register your site. To tell the search engine which pages specifically to index <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en">create an XML site map</a> and upload it to Google’s console.</p><p>Search engines can also be made aware of new content by following pre-existing content links, so a good way of drawing their attention to your site is with your own social media channels. As <strong>Twitter </strong>and <strong>LinkedIn</strong> are both publicly accessible, any content about your site added on their platforms will be indexed for search. Simply asking friends and colleagues to share your new content can also help to promote your work to search engines, media channels and hopefully employers.</p><p>The secret to building a great portfolio is to create a project that puts your best coding foot forward, that challenges you as a developer and is clear and concise. Deploying the site to the web and its codebase to GitHub will help employers discover the strength and of your coding skills and how up-to-date you are in the world of web development. In the current competitive job market, these might be the critical factors in making you and your portfolio worthy of consideration for that all-important role.</p><p><a href="../index.html">www.barryhalper.com</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=41f760f6645b" width="1" height="1" alt="">
