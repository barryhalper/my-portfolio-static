                        <h4>With coronavirus numbers rising, now is the time to recommend a show that can help you through a second wave.</h4><figure><img alt="Samurai gourmet" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ljTOm1svlptb-4WwLBitA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Takeshi views the Samurai during his first lunch.</figcaption></figure><p>For a long time now I’ve been a bit of Japanophile (<em>Shinichi </em>in Japanese). I love the romance of the Samurai, a steaming bowl of ramen, the hypnotic strangeness of Murakami’s novels, the elegance of a Kyoto temple. I could go on. I think Japanese culture entered my consciousness surreptitiously at first. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Blade Runner </em>were two films<em> </em>that<em> </em>imprinted on me at a young age, as they did to so many of my generation. These massively influential movies were themselves heavily influenced by Japan. The Samurai films (<em>Jidaigeki</em>) of Akira Kurasawa was a significant inspiration for Star Wars (<em>The Hidden Fortress</em> in particular) and <em>Blade Runner</em>, the neon-soaked streets of 1980s Tokyo. The influence these movies had on me was profound, a gateway drug to all the Japanese films, novels, Anime and noodle/sushi bars that have addicted me ever since.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/728/0*MG0hQ2ZPoiNAPDRu" /><figcaption>The feisty princess from Kurasawa’s Hidden Foteress (1958) referenced by Star Wars (1977)</figcaption></figure><p>The second time I felt Japan’s influence was via something far more personal; the marriage of my first cousin to a Japanese girl. I have always been close to my cousin, and I am happy to say we remained goods friends ever since. Years later, my cousin-in-law and her lovely family provided me with the good fortune to be to able to travel to Japan and visit them. To be sure I could connect with my Japanese cousins, I spent a few months beforehand trying to learn the language, enabling me to immerse in a culture of which I had read and seen so much. It was a fantastic and unforgettable experience that exceeded my expectations.</p><p>Skip ahead a few years then to the coronavirus pandemic of March 2020. With the outside world full of fear, desperate for something relaxing to watch and trapped in the ubiquitous <em>Netflix </em><strong>decision paralysis</strong> it was not surprising that a <em>Shinichi </em>like me<em> </em>would opt to snuggle up with a favourite slice of Japanese entertainment. Something I knew would help take the edge off.</p><p><strong>Samurai Gourmet<br></strong>This slice of life TV series explores the culinary adventures of a recently retired <em>salaryman</em> “someone who has shown an overriding loyalty and commitment to the corporation” in contemporary Japan. In the pilot, our hero <em>Takeshi Kasumi</em>, forgetting he no longer has to journey to work, finds himself at a loss with what to do with his day and decides to treat himself to a spot of lunch. He finds a nearby diner and tries to decide what to order, but as he does so, he experiences a sudden and frightening sense of guilt and shame. Just a day before, while still employed such an act of self-indulgence would have been unthinkable for a man in his position. So crippled is Takeshi with self-doubt, he is unable to summon the courage to order a beer. Just as all hope for a relaxing lunch is lost, the spirit of a brave Samurai visits our timid hero. The Samurai who embodies self-reliant confidence instils in Takeshi the courage to do what he must and order that beer. When it arrives, he gulps it down with great gusto and with his new-found fearlessness orders another. “Two beers!!” He can’t quite believe he has allowed himself such an indulgence. Takeshi now brimming with confidence orders his lunch which he enjoys with zeal and walks home, a thoroughly contented man.</p><p>And that is it.</p><p>I appreciate this doesn’t sound particularly thrilling or dramatic, but let me assure you this simple moment of comedic-drama contains so much meaning more for us all.</p><p>Our hero, played with such warmth by Naoto Takenaka is an everyman with whom we can all relate. He is neither Samurai nor gourmet, just an ordinary guy whose whole working life has been socially confining in much the same way the has Lockdown has for us. Takeshi is able in his retirement to find a new sense of freedom by exploring the simplest pleasures in life — good food.</p><p>In the second episode, Takeshi returns home, disappointed after being served a cold and lifeless bowl of ramen for lunch. His understanding wife, sensing his despondency decides to make him a bowl of instant noodles. What follows is a series of almost fetishistically long takes of her preparing this ordinary meal; noodles being lowered gently into simmering water, an egg lovingly sliced and spring onions precisely chopped. This focus on the meticulous preparation of the simplest of dishes demonstrates that with enough care and attention, something as ordinary instant ramen can achieve the culinary heights of gourmet cuisine. That is why for Takeshi after finishing his bowl, he is in rapture.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/0*pwr1kIgcdfV-ZJIK" /><figcaption>Elation after eating some instant noodles</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mindfulness</strong><br>The way the show painstakingly focuses on the smallest of details in food preparation is the essence of “mindfulness”, the awareness and full engagement with the present moment. This mental state in which one focuses the attention on the present moment helps to rest the mind from the maelstrom of thoughts we can often lose ourselves within.</p><blockquote>“In teaching the mind to be present, we are teaching ourselves to live more mindfully — in the present, taking a breath, not beholden to reactive thoughts and feelings — which is particularly helpful when faced with challenging circumstances or difficult situations.” <br><a href="https://www.headspace.com/mindfulness">https://www.headspace.com/mindfulness</a></blockquote><p>If you have ever eaten in a sushi bar, you may have experienced this meticulous and mindful quality in Japanese cuisine where each distinct morsel focuses your attention on a simple but intense flavour combination. In contrast with other cuisines in which each mouthful is the same as the last.</p><p>Samurai Gourmet effortlessly captures this sense of mindfulness. If <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mindfulness/">as many psychologists contend</a> that being rooted in the present is an essential mental state for good mental health, then this show is particularly fitting for the Lockdown. When the world around us is full of fear and uncertainty is it more important than ever to take a moment and savour the simplest things in life, like Takeshi his culinary adventures.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*mtFsBTfFqINlAX_oLjltbA.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>The beauty of simplicity<br></strong> There is often a misconception that something <em>simple</em> is therefore <em>easy</em>. Any chef worth his salt will tell you that this is not the case. I know from years of experience as a <strong>web developer,</strong> achieving <em>simplicity </em>in design and form takes a significant amount of patience and discipline. <em>Samurai Gourmet</em> is a show that exemplifies how <em>simplicity </em>can transform the most mundane of experiences into something beautiful. That is what makes it such a pleasure to watch. It is also a trait of Japanese food and culture I find most appealing, especially now when the simplest of things are all we have in these difficult times.</p><p>Whether you are Japanophile or not and regardless of the second Lockdown this show will send you off to bed with a warm glow this Autumn.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80132738">Watch Samurai Gourmet on Netflix</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7ddf7f69b8a3" width="1" height="1">
