                        <p>During the lockdown of 2020, a laptop proved to be so much more than a tool for a web professional.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OXRaUgPXxWs6Om6S" /></figure><p>The pandemic was in its fourth month, and like millions of others around the world, I was unable to leave the house or go to work, leaving me with an unnerving sense of isolation. During this period, the office laptop had been an essential tool with which I could feel connected to the world outside. Then in July after three months in the “new normal” of working from home, I was made redundant. This was a blow to be sure. After 20 years with my firm, I was now another economic victim of the <strong>global pandemic </strong>(s<a href="https://medium.com/@barryhalper/redundant-in-a-time-of-cholera-83112fdc6901">ee my previous post)</a>.</p><p>A few hours after I was laid-off, the IT department shut down the laptop. With this seemingly innocuous function, I felt they had diminished my ability to connect to the world, increasing my sense of being isolated, marooned on my island.</p><p>After giving it some thought, I decided the best course of action would be to use my <strong>redundancy </strong>as an opportunity and treat myself to a new laptop. It should be a machine with more than enough power to run all my development tools and sleek enough to handle all my (substantial) media demands.</p><p>The first computer I ever bought was the original and iconic <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/laptops/news/apple/144413-20-years-of-the-imac-looking-back-at-apple-s-legendary-imac-g3">Apple iMac G3</a>. It was an inspiration. The first desktop computer explicitly designed for the internet was the ideal tool to begin exploring the world of the web. In those days, it was a place that appealed to my geeky side. I had always been someone who loved to jump down a rabbit hole of nerdy fact-finding, trivia and critical analysis that was (and still is )so much of its stock-in-trade. With the iMac, I felt the web was a world I wanted to stay and make my mark.</p><p>Whenever I hear the easy-listening tones of <em>Coldplay’s</em> first album <em>Parachutes,</em> I find myself back in those halcyon days, sitting intently in front of my gleaming machine with its bold colours, and retro-futuristic curves, a stash of how-to guides piled up next to me<em>. </em>A new horizon of career possibilities opened up before me.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1sGYWGWBlCqJxdn-OP9CDQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Apple iMac G3</figcaption></figure><p>Over time as my development skills improved, I became increasingly disillusioned with the iMac. It couldn’t run IIS, Microsoft’s web server or Allaire’s Coldfusion Server, meaning no support for the development frameworks I was starting to explore. I remember at the time a colleague of mine advising,</p><blockquote>“Macs are for fun, but serious developers use Windows or Unix.”</blockquote><p>For this reason, I headed down the path of Windows development, where I have remained ever since. In the decades since Apple has transformed it’s OS into a heavyweight development platform with a large and passionate following among web professionals. For me, however, to switch to a different platform at this stage of my career seemed pointless not to mention exorbitantly expensive. I decided to stick with what I knew, which meant a new windows laptop.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zfSxCBw8IyuajCuTcMOCsA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Developer essentials kit for 2020</figcaption></figure><p>After days of surfing the web’s endless tech resources, the clear contender for the laptop I needed was the <strong>Dell XPS</strong>. Time and again, it scored highest for performance, usability and build quality. With its 10th generation Intel core I7 processor, it could efficiently run all my apps, and the 16GB RAM would be more than enough to handle the demanding needs of web development.</p><p>Where this laptop comes into its own is the <strong>2-in-1 convertible </strong>feature. Just turning the hinge back on the lid turns the XPS into a premium touchpad, opening it up to the world of media I was previously only accessed on my phone.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/390/0*hCLbkfK1OwG9ANP6" /><figcaption>Dell XPS convertible</figcaption></figure><p>As the iMac had done twenty years earlier, the sleek design and performance of the <strong>Dell</strong> <strong>XPS</strong> expanded my horizons in many ways connecting me to the world of development. Allowing me to explore the continually evolving landscape of tools, frameworks and languages that make up the world of web. What’s more, it led me to realise what great tools for nurturing creativity computers can be. For me, this was not only in terms of development, but crucially it helped rekindle an interest in writing I had not considered since the days before I became a developer.</p><p>In these trying times of global pandemic, fear, redundancy, isolation from the outside world, it’s in the inner life of the imagination where hopefully we can find some sense of escape and maybe even freedom. As the lockdown shows little sign of ending any time soon and we can feel trapped on our islands, it’s reassuring to feel there is a <strong>life-raft</strong> on which I can sail away.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ca723b5535c3" width="1" height="1" alt="">
