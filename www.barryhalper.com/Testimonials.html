He is extremely creative and innovative, and was always looking for new ways to improve how we delivered digital services.he took a lot of time to understand exactly what I needed to do my job effectively and would constantly be suggesting ideas that would save me time on a day-to - day basis and deliver a better experience for our readers and advertisers.He also genuinely cared about the work he was doing and this showed in his commitment to the job.

We collaborated on several website projects and he was knowledgeable, patient, and generous with his time. He was also always open to exploring new ways of doing things, trying out new technologies, and finding creative solutions to problems. And if some of our ideas were not possible, he would take the time to explain why and offer alternative suggestions. He managed to make the often stressful process of launching digital projects fun.</span> "

I generally find Barry very easy to work with. He is solutions focussed and is often determined to find a way to achieve what we ask of him. This has been particularly notable when working on some of the complex statistical elements of the MYB-PS development where formulae have had to be rewritten in .NET  to allow the correct data to render in the correct format on the website. &#xA;On occasions when development has had to be agile to create new features according to feedback, he&#x27;s interpreted these requirements well and has turned them into key functionality. All in all, I find Barry professional and very easy to work and communicate with and he remains a key partnership for me in the Hemming Group. &#xA;    </span> "
